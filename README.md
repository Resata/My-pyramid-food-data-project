# My-pyramid-food-data-project
MyPyramid Food Data provides information on the total calories; calories from solid fats, added sugars, and alcohol (extras); MyPyramid food group and subgroup amounts; and saturated fat content of over 1,000 commonly eaten foods with corresponding commonly used portion amounts.

The analysis was carried out on the "lu_Condiment_Food_Table" dataset which is one of the three datasets published by the FNS. The dataset has 63 condiments used in meals along with their corresponding portion size, grain content, meat content, calories content and many other features.
